# Random Walk Simulation

This project simulates a one-dimensional symmetric random walk using Monte Carlo methods and analyses its statistical properties.

## Model
At each time step, the walker moves +1 or −1 with equal probability. Multiple independent walks are simulated to study the process's behaviour.

## Results
- Individual paths are highly noisy and unpredictable
- The expected position remains close to zero with a normal distribution
- The variance of the position grows approximately linearly with time
